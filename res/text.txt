jar cf jar-file input-file(s)
You can use any filename for a JAR file
The options and arguments used in this command are:
The c option indicates that you want to create a JAR file.
The basic format of the command for creating a JAR file is:
The input-file(s) argument can contain the wildcard * symbol
jar-file is the name that you want the resulting JAR file to have
The command will also generate a default manifest file for the JAR archive
By convention, JAR filenames are given a .jar extension, though this is not required.
The f option indicates that you want the output to go to a file rather than to stdout.
This command will generate a compressed JAR file and place it in the current directory
The c and f options can appear in either order, but there must not be any space between them.
The input-file(s) argument is a space-separated list of one or more files that you want to include in your JAR file
If any of the "input-files" are directories, the contents of those directories are added to the JAR archive recursively.
